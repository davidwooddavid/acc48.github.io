  <h4>Transport</h4>

<p> Monash University is 25km south-east of the centre of Melbourne. Monash University has several campuses. 48ACC is at the main campus, 
called "<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aiAoBNR9k942">Clayton campus</a>". 

<p>Melbourne airport is about 20km north-west of the centre of Melbourne, on the opposite side of the city to  Monash. 

<h4> Direct transport from airport to Monash</h4>

<p>  A taxi from the airport to Monash University is approximately $120. 
</p>

  Dandenong</a> operates a  shuttle service between the airport and
  Monash University ($?? each way). Bookings are essential. 

<h4> Public transport from airport to Monash</h4>

<p> All public transport options from the airport to Monash go through central Melbourne. </p>
  
<p>    For travel from the airport to central Melbourne, take a taxi  (approximately $60) or the <a  href="https://www.skybus.com.au/">skybus</a> ($20.60 each way). There  is no train to the airport. The  skybus takes you to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/599TSjDVX8Q2">Southern
  Cross Station</a> at the western end of central Melbourne. The other  major train stations in Melbourne city are <a href
  ="https://goo.gl/maps/z9SFzSZPipG2 ">Flinders Street  Station</a> and 
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fbtb7AQ31TD2">Melbourne Central</a>. </p>

<p>    To get from the city to Monash University, take the <a  href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/route/11">Pakenham Line</a> or <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/route/4">Cranbourne
  Line</a> train, and get off at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tEEUAPoaadH2">Huntingdale Station</a>. These trains leave from any of the 
major city train stations (Southern Cross, Flinders Street, Melbourne Central). From Huntingdale, take a bus to Monash
  (route <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/route/12750/601">601</a>, <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/route/13067/630">630</a>
  or <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/route/12753/900">900</a>). The  601 runs every 5 minutes for most of the day. </p>

<p>    To use public transport in Melbourne, you need to <a
  href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/ef1d0f60a/buying-your-myki/">purchase
  a myki card</a> ($6) and then <a
  href="https://ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/myki-money/">add money to
  the card</a>., or you can use the <a href="  https://transport.vic.gov.au/plan-a-journey/public-transport-tools-and-resources/travel-tips-and-resources/mobile-apps-for-public-transport">PTV app</a> on your mobile phone.  
   Myki can be used on trains, trams and buses (but not the  skybus to and from the airport). </p>

  <!--
  It is recommended you buy a myki card, since you can use it again to get to the conference  dinner.</p>
